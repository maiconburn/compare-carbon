The 36,000 fuel efficient stoves sold to date have improved the lives of over 165,000 people. Myanmar is the third largest contributor to deforestation worldwide. As the forests disappear, the price of wood gets higher, driving more and more families into energy poverty. Cutting expenditures on wood makes a huge difference to families already living in poverty, and reducing the time needed to forage for wood means more time to spend on smallholdings and on securing a good harvest. Rural families in Myanmar spend as much as 40% of their income – or the time equivalent – on purchasing or collecting firewood.",

Extreme weather events and increasingly unpredictable patterns have significantly disrupted crop yields – this is particularly devastating for those communities who rely on their crops both for their own nutrition and for ensuring their incomes. The Utsil Naj programme has been designed as a multi-intervention large-scale programme of activities for Latin America. It disseminates technologies with strong social impacts to poor populations of the continent in order to improve their living conditions in a sustainable way. The project focuses on rural beneficiaries who are often the most vulnerable communities.",

          'Mandulis Energy has pioneered a way to transform waste from farming into charcoal briquettes, creating clean energy in the process. This project helps displaced persons in the Adjumani settlements of Northern Uganda. The current "three stone stoves" used by residents produce smoke equivalent to smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day. By 2023, once this project has fully scaled up to the 16 sites it has planned for, the clean burning briquettes will meet nearly all of the cooking fuel needs of the 200,000 refugee households in Uganda, while saving over a million trees each year.',

          "The Burn Stoves Project provides communities with an efficient cookstove that benefits the environment and improves health. The stoves are manufactured at a solar powered factory in Nairobi, which employs 100+ people. It is important to note that 80% of Kenya’s primary household energy still comes from solid fuel. The majority of this is burnt on smoky open fires and inefficient cookstoves, leading to indoor air pollution causing respiratory disease, and contributing to global climate change. Cooking smoke {which most affects women and children} contributes to a range of chronic illnesses and acute health impacts such as early childhood pneumonia, emphysema, lung cancer, bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, and low birth weight. This said, the “stoves use 45% less charcoal – meaning families can recover the initial outlay within 2-3 months of purchase and then save up to $300 in fuel costs every year. Furthermore, this increased efficiency also cuts carbon emissions, speeds up cooking time and significantly improves health by reducing smoke emissions during cooking.",

          "The Aqua Clara Water Filtration Programme, through the Aqua Clara Foundation, has a flagship product known as the ACF bio-sand water purifier. This zero energy ACF water purifier displaces the use of firewood fuel traditionally used to boil water for domestic consumption. ACF water purifier project seeks to introduce approximately 23,875 Bio Sand purifiers, 4 Large Scale Sand and Membrane Filters and approximately 4,800 household SAM units in rural and peri-urban Kenya and in so doing reduce 181,797 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. While many of these families do boil water to purify it for drinking purposes, continued use of firewood for this purpose has led to destruction of woodlands. Coupled with this widespread deforestation is the contribution of the households to local carbon dioxide emissions as well as indoor air pollution within the respective domestic units.",

          "\n\nCarbonfund.org supports the Truck Stop Electrification Project which reduces tailpipe emissions from freight trucks that transport our consumer goods all across the country. Long-haul truck drivers idle their trucks to heat or cool their cab and to power on-board appliances during the federally mandated rest period. Engine idling creates poor resting conditions for the driver and fosters unhealthy conditions since a large number of trucks idle in close proximity. Idling also consumes fuel while moving no product, reduces engine life, and requires more frequent engine maintenance. With this project, drivers can shut off their engines and utilize the advanced truck stop electrification technology. This system consists of an in-cab service module connected via a flexible hose to an efficient external unit that heats, cools, and powers the interior of the truck, and lets the driver run the radio and check email without forcing the engine to burn diesel while saving about a gallon of diesel per hour.\n",

          "Our first forest was born in 2017 thanks to the contribution of 865 reforesters from all over the world, who backed our Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in February 2017. Génesis has been officially certified as a carbon capture project by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food - Ministry for the Ecological Transition (Mapama) through its bureau of climate change. By investing in this project today you are supporting our whole community and pushing us one step further to grow its surface area. ",

Protecting an area more than 3.5 times the size of Manhattan, the project targets the Merang biodiversity corridor, one of the largest and deepest peat swamps in South Sumatra. Climate finance rehabilitates and protects this threatened ecosystem, reducing emissions, and creating a conservation area for hundreds of unique and endangered species. The project works with local communities from nearby villages to improve livelihoods which reduces pressure on the forest. This project is part of the Ecosphere+ portfolio financed by the Althelia Climate Fund, and implemented in partnership with PT Global Alam Lestari (GAL) and Forest Carbon.",

And we know it’s not going to save itself. So, it is up to us to solve it. But what levers can we pull? Reducing our carbon footprint is entirely necessary, but the transition of change is far slower than the time we have remaining. The tools that we associate with fighting climate change are inadequate. What if that changed and the billions of us who care became empowered? There are enough climate solutions that are out there right now, that if we supported them, it’d undo 30 years of carbon damage by avoiding 1,500 billion tonnes of CO2. This is our opportunity.\n",

Each month they support a range of carbon reduction projects that are certified at the very highest level by Gold Standard and equivalents. Their profit is measured in impact, and this is reflected in how they spend your money. 85% of your money goes directly to funding these planet saving projects. Included with project costs are any incurred transaction fees carried out on your behalf.

The quality of our schemes is assured by the UK government’s Woodland Carbon Code and the IUCN's Peatland Code, both of which certify our projects in important areas like biodiversity, ‘additionality’, risk management and carbon capture measurement. Compensating for your unavoidable environmental impact by helping to create a new woodland or restore a degraded peatland is rewarding in many ways.

        project_description:
          "In Rwanda, firewood accounts for at least 86% of energy consumption and is the primary cooking fuel for 98% of rural households. The distribution of fuel-efficient cook stoves reduces the amount of wood burning in households, which means less harmful smoke, less indoor air pollution, and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. The stoves are designed and produced in-country, providing much-needed training and employment to the region and ensuring that they are tailored to the cooking needs of families. CO2balance works closely with local NGOs and governments to ensure that stoves are distributed to regions without pre-existing markets for efficient wood burning stoves. The stove is supplied at a highly-subsidised rate to ensure affordability for families unfamiliar with improved devices; in this way, CO2balance hopes to kick-start demand for improved cooking technology across the country. This programme is comprised of fourteen micro projects, each of which will create 10,000 tonnes of emissions reductions through reducing the combustion of unsustainably-harvested biomass. The programme aims to reduce pressure on woodlands and wildlife, reduce indoor air pollution and improve the lives of local families.",

Charcoal prices have been rising recently, creating economic difficulties for people in the peri-urban areas. Cooking with biomass in non-efficient stoves has dangerous effects to health, contributing to the emergence of respiratory diseases, affecting mostly women and children. In addition, the use of charcoal in inefficient stoves contributes to rapid deforestation and forest degradation. This project has distributed 5,731 clean cookstoves to low income households that significantly reduce the amount of charcoal required (currently, charcoal spend is 30% of the target group’s monthly income), promote good health by reducing indoor air pollution and provide access to affordable and clean energy.",

        project_description:
          "This voluntary project provides improved cook stoves within Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world where 98% of families cook using firewood and charcoal. The Chitetezo Mbaula clay stove uses much less firewood that traditional stoves and is easy and convenient to use, helping households to take that first step away from open fires, which pollute the air both in and outside of the home. The stoves are affordable (USD1-2), made entirely in Malawi, and accessible to those who need it most, mainly women cooking with wood on open fires. This project also helps young children to attend school and receive a proper meal. The Mayankho stove can feed 540 children in one meal and uses less fuel, produces less smoke, and cooks more quickly. The stove design also reduces the risk of the pot falling and scalding or burning the cooks – an issue with the traditional three stone fire stove.",

The resulting forests offer a natural habitat for native animals and plants, protect and enrich the soil, save and filter water and contribute to the mitigation of climate change. The project, initially developed by Forest Finance and recently extended by the partner Sustainable Timber and Isla Cebaco, is based on a model that combines sustainable, high quality timber production with biodiversity protection and ecosystem restoration. By also planting a mix of cacao and native tree species in some areas, the project also enables sustainable cacao production.",

          "Based in a region prone to poverty and severe drought, this initiative tackles one of the major causes of deforestation in Brazil: illegal logging. The Ceará project has switched the fuel used by five ceramic factories from illegal firewood to agricultural and industrial residues. This biomass would have otherwise been discarded as waste, so the fuel switch not only transforms residues into something useful but also enables many local individuals to make a living - or complement their income – by supplying biomass waste directly to the factories. Furthermore, the reduction in indoor air pollution from the switch has substantially improved working conditions for employees and the ceramic factories have adopted a system that reuses industrial wastewater. An especially significant step for a region afflicted by severe droughts. This project alleviates deforestation, avoids greenhouse gas emissions and promotes a more sustainable supply chain: It does this whilst also improving the livelihoods of local communities and employees. Making good better.",

          "The Utsil Naj programme has been designed as a multi-intervention large-scale programme of activities for Latin America. It disseminates technologies with strong social impacts to poor populations of the continent in order to improve their living conditions in a sustainable way. The project focuses on rural beneficiaries who are often the most vulnerable communities. Utsil Naj currently operates in Guatemala, Mexico (LINK), and Honduras (LINK), where Microsol teamed up with local partners selected for their experience on the ground and their understanding and relations with the communities benefiting from the programme. To date, the programme has installed more than 22 000 improved cookstoves, benefitting over 100,000 people living in poverty.",

The program plants teak and other valuable species for future timber production and added-value wood production as well as other measures aimed at increasing resilience in the local municipalities. The project protects the remaining patches of native vegetation and creates additional conservation areas on the banks of rivers and other watersheds. The forests offer a natural habitat for native animals and plants, protect and enrich the soil, save and filter water and contribute to the mitigation of the greenhouse effect. The Nicaforest Program is in its pilot phase and is certified by Gold Standard and Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC). The Norwegian company Across Forest AS is the promoter and the subsidiary, Nicaforest Plantations S.a in Santo Tomas, Chontales region in Nicaragua, is operating the program in Nicaragua.",

          "Tens of thousands of refugees from Darfur are offered the chance to vastly improve their life by using the CooKit solar cookers. Having to venture outside of the camp to collect scarce firewood and the risk of being attacked or raped has been an everyday fear for women in the refugee camps in Eastern Chad, close to the Sudanese border. We are providing them with the necessary material, knowledge and training to manufacture their own solar cooker and to prepare their meals using energy from the sun. Since the start of the programme in 2005, 40.000 families in the refugee camps and the surrounding villages have been equipped with solar cookers made out of carton and aluminium foil that, when folded in a semi-parabolic form can be used to heat water and cook entire meals. Due to the omnipresence of sun in this region, the cooker can be used 330 days out of the year, thus almost completely eliminating the need for firewood.",

        project_description:
          "Deforestation and climate change are threatening the coffee sector in Ethiopia. Coffee is extremely sensitive to rising temperatures. An increase of just one degree already results in a loss of quality of the coffee beans, two degrees means a loss of productivity and at three degrees the coffee plant has difficulty surviving. If current trends continue, coffee could become a scarce commodity in the coming decades. Small-scale farmers are particularly hit hard. Rapid deforestation in Ethiopia is leading to increasing drought. Coffee farmers (often women) that depend on the income that their land generates and are financially unable to bear the consequences of the changing climate. In this project, nearly 20,000 households are benefitting from a more efficient cookstove, the Tikikil, for general use and a Mirt, for a flat round bread made of teff flour (Injera) to bake. The Tikikil replaces the much-used traditional way of cooking on an open fire. The participating households own the cookstoves and pay for these stoves partly in cash and partly with the CO2 credits that the use yields.\n\n",

          "In Guinea, firewood and charcoal meet around 98% of the household energy needs. Demographic growth is leading to an increasing pressure on the woodlands, with deforestation currently progressing at 6'800'000 m3/year. According to FAO figures, Guinean forests have decreased by around 10% over the last 20 years. Women and children are often in charge of wood collection, a time-consuming and sometimes dangerous task, which can take up to 15 hours per week just to meet the needs of one household. Generally, cooking is then done on open low efficiency hearths. Consuming a high quantity of firewood and generating a lot of smoke. Long-term use of these open hearths are known to cause serious respiratory diseases. Through the distribution of cookstoves adapted to the needs of the local communities, this project aims to improve the conditions of Guinean households, tackle global warming and reduce pressure on woodlands by preventing some of the drivers of deforestation.",

Cooking on biogas is fast and smokeless, improving family health, especially among women and children. Leftover slurry from the biogas process is an excellent organic fertilizer that improves crop yields – and having more vegetables to sell, provides families with extra income. The Kenya Biogas Programme provides biodigesters to individual households. The programme was founded by the Africa Biogas Partnership Programme (ABPP), a partnership between the Dutch government, Hivos and SNV Netherlands Development Organization, in support of national programmes in five African countries including Kenya. The overall objective of ABPP is to develop a commercially viable biogas sector that supports the use of domestic biogas as a local, sustainable energy source.",

          "This clean cooking and heating project, helps people from the Shanxi, Hubei and Guizhou Provinces of China save money, while creating jobs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The project encourages a switch in fuel through the use of cleaner cookstoves that use excess agriculture residues (a 100% renewable fuel source), renewable wood, or improve the efficiency of coal consumption. By reducing coal consumption and substituting coal with renewable biomass, the stoves reduce carbon emissions and decrease the exposure to indoor air pollution, including arsenic and fluoride.  ",

          "Households save $1,500 - $2,000 on fuel over the stove’s five-year lifetime ",
          "Households save $37 - $50 for every dollar spent on the stove",
          "Funds saved can go toward food, clothing, medical bills, and other household necessities",

          "Since 2011, FairClimateFund has been working with its local partner JSMBT to supply locally-produced cookstoves or Chulikas to 18,000 farming families. The design of the Chulika ensures that air is preheated and there is a complete combustion without visible smoke and only small amounts of ash. The Chulika is suitable for cooking, grilling, baking typical Indian flat bread and heating water. The Chulika saves the use of wood by around 70%. This reduces carbon emissions by around 2 tonnes per family per year. The Chulika also leads to reduced smoke and an improved living environment. In this way, forest areas are protected and women spend less time and energy collecting wood.",

Despite many taking this boiling precaution, preventable illness from drinking contaminated water is still a leading cause of death for children under five. But with a water filter at home, families can produce their own safe water every day. The filters do more than just fend off thirst and illness. Without the need for boiling water, families are able to buy or collect less wood and fossil fuels, reducing smoke in the kitchen, and protecting Laos’ beautiful forests from further deforestation. TerraClear is breaking down the barriers that make clean water access a challenge for rural communities. Creative strategies and community focused education and promotion are allowing TerraClear to change lives a few liters at a time. TerraClear is providing access to safe drinking water through the manufacture and distribution of more than 33,000 ceramic filters reaching an estimated 150,000 people in over 500 villages in Laos.",

Improved access to electricity also reduces the dependency on fuel wood, helping to relieve deforestation pressures in the local environment. The power plant has a total installed capacity of 6.8 MW and generates up to 23,000 MWh of green energy per year - the equivalent to the energy consumed by 5000 western style families.

          "The MICROSOL initiative, “Qori Q’oncha – Improved Cookstoves Diffusion Programme in Peru”, is coordinating various actions for distributing lifesaving cookstoves in Peru. The improved cookstoves (ICS) replace three stone or a terracotta stove and are constructed with local material by local people. Each new stove sold emits less greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions compared to the original stove, helping to bring down global emissions. The project helps vulnerable families in rural regions gain access to energy and cooking solutions that are better for their health, cheaper to run and require less firewood. More than 140,000 improved cookstoves have been installed and are benefiting approximately 600,000 people living in poverty. Qori Q'oncha was the first ever Gold Standard PoA for Cookstoves to become Gold Standard certified and issue credits. It was also acknowledged with a PCIA special achievement award for meeting social and behaviour needs and was recognised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as the best solution in Peru for access to carbon finance in the framework of a regional initiative in Latin America.",

          "Since 2009, FairClimateFund has been working with its local partner ADATS to supply biogas installations to 12,000 farming families in the Chickballapur district of Karnataka province. Organic waste (mainly cow dung) is converted in an underground bio-digester into methane gas for cooking. About 2 cows are needed to provide an average household with sufficient gas for cooking on a daily basis. Cooking with biogas is clean, there is no release of harmful smoke. This means health benefits for the whole family, in particular for women and children. In addition, women no longer have to fetch wood, cooking is easier and faster, and it prevents black soot deposits in the house. On average, women save eight hours a week by using biogas. This time can be spent on family, household or economic activities.\n\n",

The smallest and most popular digester on the market, it can treat the waste from 2-3 bovines or 4-6 pigs and costs around $500 excluding an investment subsidy of $150. The Cambodian National Biodigester Programme was originally set up in 2006 by the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and SNV Netherlands Development Organization. In the period March 2006 to December 2019 nearly 28,000 biodigesters were constructed through 118 micro-enterprises in 15 provinces. The programme was one of the first large-scale biogas projects certified to Gold Standard with support from HIVOS. Since 2017, MAFF uses money generated from the sale of carbon credits to continue running and expanding this programme.",
